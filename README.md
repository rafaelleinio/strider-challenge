# strider-challenge

## How to use?

### Testing the CLI on docker compose
Build and create all infrastructure:
```bash
make app
```

Now inside container... 

Create all model tables:
```bash
scli init-db
```

Run load commands to populate the tables:
```bash
# internal data
scli load --model movie --collector csv --config data/internal/movies.csv
scli load --model stream --collector csv --config data/internal/streams.csv
scli load --model user --collector csv --config data/internal/users.csv

# vendor data
scli load --model author --collector json --config data/vendor/authors.json
scli load --model book --collector json --config data/vendor/books.json
scli load --model review --collector json --config data/vendor/reviews.json
```

All done! ðŸš€

Now in your favorite DB IDE (without closing the previous process), you can connect to 
`postgresql://postgres:postgres@db:5432/dw` and query the models.

## Analytical queries over test data:
> _**Disclaimer**: for productive environments, some queries (if they need to run regularly)_ 
> _would benefit from templating input values (like timestamps)_
